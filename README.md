Imagine, for a moment, you wanted to reverse engineer a popular platform fighter.
Now let's say you had a specific one in mind. In this case, we will imagine that there exists
a platform fighter called Supra Smash Balls Mayo (SSBM for all future references.).

Now, lets speculate on this hypothetical game. What does SSBM have?

1. High technical cieling
2. Popular IP that everyone loves
3. Dedicated fanbase
4. A company that no longer cares about it
5. CRTs

Ok, so emulating all of that will be hard. But, maybe we don't want all of those qualities.

**What is realistic**

- High technical cieling

This is largly an issue of programming rigor, listening to the comunity, and having a good sense of the games competitive spirit. This is an achievable quality.

- Popular IP that everone loves

Unfortunatly, this exact quality is the source of a lot of the strife that is causing us to want to make a clean break from SSBM. I think it is fair to say that this quality is not achievable, at least not initially. With good design and coherent art direction new IPs can be invented and with care the comunity can come to love them.

This will of course require the comunity to be in a state where it is receptive to experiencing new IPs. It would be a shame if SSBM's IP holder snubbed the comunity repeatedly.

- Dedicated fanbase

Again, difficult to achieve without comunity engagement. Probably impossible to do initially. If one wanted to build hype around this theorhetical community driven SSBM alternative they would try to get prominent comunity members involved or aware.

- A company that no longer cares about it

Not a desirable quality. Largly why this project would be undertaken.

- CRTs

Anything to keep them out of landfills.

Ok, so the final tally: 1 is realistic, the others are either impossible, undesirable, or very conditional.

So what are we to do? Give up now, before we write any code? Well, here's the thing. Doing the GOOD stuff, doing the RIGHT stuff, is hard. Like, really hard. But you know what else is hard? Getting gude at SSBM, and I couldn't do that. And those who can't "do", make.

The following posts will chronicle my journey to re-invigerate the competitive comunity, to bring power to the players over the project, and to make the best damn Platform-Fighter the world has ever seen.

**4/26/24 8:00pm**

Ok, so first we should come up with a wish list for our game. Imagine, for a moment, that you can modify SSBM in any way that you want. Change it to your little sweaty hearts desire. What things might we want to add?

The following is a list of my humble suggestions:

1. RollBack netcode

You know what sucks? Delay based netcode. You know what else sucks? Authoritative servers. You know what doesn't suck? P2P Rollback.

Ok, so Rollback isn't magic, and it can't fix horrible unstable connections. But is by far the best option for an online competitive fighting game.

2. Competitive stats tracking

A record and history of all matches played, their results and statistics. With the included ability to look at other players stats.

3. Replays

The ability to find and replay previous matches.

4. Match making

There should be a system that can automatically match players together.

5. Ranked

Obviously.

6. Spectator mode

There are two major draws to Platoform fighters. The first is the expressive movement and free form combos. The second is the spectacle. I think this is where a lot of modern platform fighters fall short. They just aren't that interesting to watch. To be fair though, that seems to be a problem for a lot of fighters out there. They are fun to watch generally if you know what's going on, but we want something that draw in a crowd, even if that crowd isn't 100% sure what's going on.

7. Tournement Organizing software.

Competition is the whole point of the project, so I think helping TO's out with implementing online tournements can only be a plus.

8. A training mode

A comprehensive training mode that exposes the deeper technical side of the game. Prefereably customizable scenarios. I do have concerns with implementing an AI (CPU) player, though. But we will talk about that in a later post.

Ok, so that seems like a decent wish list so far, maybe Santa will deliver if we are good boys and girls.
